/* The macro TRP permits the definition of restart points. All parameters
   are output parameters: rp contains the restart point
			  rest is the result of the macro
				-1	there is an error
				 0	normal return
				 1	a transaction is restarting
			  TRANID contains the transaction id of the tran
			       which is restarting or -1 otherwise

   This macro should be called from the "root" where all DB calls are realized.
   This is because of the setjmp operation: contexts saved by this operation
   are lost when the function which set it returns.

   A restart point is associated with a transaction when the last one is
   started  (i.e. trstart(degree,options, rp))

   When a restartable transaction associated with a rp restart point
   is killed by a deadlock problem, the control will be tranfered
   (i.e. longjmp) to this rp restart point.

   TRrestp is a table on the process space containing the association between
   transactions and the stack context saved by setjmp. (In general, the restart
   property will only apply to PSWAIT (wait with process suspension) and
   CLWAIT (wait with client process suspension) transactions).
